# Computer-Graphics

Completing assignments such as simulating a walking robot with swinging arms and legs, observing polygons from changing perspectives, and performing motions like rotation and folding. Our group also completed a project constructing a house model with simple furniture and interactive items like a teapot pouring water into a cup. Furthermore, we implemented advanced features like mirror reflections, transparent objects, shadows, bump mapping, light source visualization through the camera, and animated objects.
