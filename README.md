# Computer-Graphics

Completing assignments such as simulating a walking robot with swinging arms and legs, observing polygons from changing perspectives, and performing motions like rotation and folding. Our group also completed a project constructing a house model with simple furniture and interactive items like a teapot pouring water into a cup. Furthermore, we implemented advanced features like mirror reflections, transparent objects, shadows, bump mapping, light source visualization through the camera, and animated objects.


### Notices:
1. Please first download glew.dll and create the proper environment before executing the files. Once the environment is set up, you can run the '.exe' files to see how the assignments and the project work.
2. Transform.cpp is just an individual file to test your environment, and there is an assignment in it.
